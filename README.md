# FriendFinder

* This app is kind of like a dating site but for friends. 
  It's as simple as taking a survey. You fill out your name,
  provide a photo of yourself, and then answer the 10 questions
  asked.

* The answers you provide will then in turn be compared to the
  answers given by other users. You'll be matched up with the
  person who has the score closest to yours!
